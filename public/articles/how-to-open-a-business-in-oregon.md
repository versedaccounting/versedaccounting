# How to Open a Business in Oregon: Step-by-Step Guide (2025)

Thinking about starting a business in Oregon? Great choice! Oregon offers a welcoming environment for entrepreneurs, with low startup costs, a strong local economy, and a wide range of support resources.

In this article, we‚Äôll walk you through every step needed to officially launch your business in Oregon.

## 1. Choose the Right Business Structure

The first decision is selecting the best legal structure for your business:

- **Sole Proprietorship**: Easy to set up but doesn‚Äôt offer personal liability protection.
- **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: Popular for small businesses. Offers liability protection and flexibility.
- **Corporation (C or S Corp)**: Ideal for businesses seeking investors or issuing shares.
- **Partnership**: Best for businesses with two or more owners sharing responsibilities.

üí° Most entrepreneurs start with an LLC for legal protection and simplicity.

## 2. Pick and Register a Business Name

Check name availability using the [Oregon Business Name Search Tool](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/cbrmanager/index).

You can also register a **DBA (‚ÄúDoing Business As‚Äù)** if operating under a different name than your legal entity.

## 3. Register Your Business with the Oregon Secretary of State

Visit [sos.oregon.gov/business](https://sos.oregon.gov/business) to register online.

- LLC filing fee: $100 (as of 2025)
- Corporation filing fee: $100

You'll receive your Entity Number once the registration is approved.

## 4. Apply for a Federal EIN (Employer Identification Number)

This number is essential for:
- Opening a business bank account
- Hiring employees
- Filing taxes

Apply for free at the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).

## 5. Open a Business Bank Account

Keep personal and business finances separate. Bring:
- Your EIN
- Business formation documents
- Business registration confirmation

Most Oregon banks offer special accounts for small businesses.

## 6. Register for Oregon Business Taxes

You may need to register for:
- **Oregon Statewide Transit Tax**
- **Corporate Activity Tax (CAT)** if revenue exceeds $1M/year
- **Withholding tax and payroll reporting** (if hiring employees)

Use the [Oregon Revenue Online Portal](https://revenueonline.dor.oregon.gov) to register.

## 7. Get Local Business Licenses and Permits

Check local requirements with your city or county office. For Carlton, OR:
- A city business license may be required.
- Food, health, or professional services may require extra permits.
- Home-based businesses may need a home occupation permit.

## 8. Understand Ongoing Requirements

Once your business is running, you‚Äôll need to:
- File an annual report with the Secretary of State ($100/year)
- Track and pay taxes regularly
- Renew business licenses as needed
- Maintain clear bookkeeping and records

üìå Tip: Hire a professional accountant to ensure compliance and reduce risk.

## 9. Explore Oregon Small Business Resources

Take advantage of state-wide support programs:
- **Oregon SBDC Network**: Free training and mentoring ‚Äì [oregonsbdc.org](https://oregonsbdc.org)
- **Business Oregon**: State economic development programs
- **SCORE Oregon**: Free mentoring and templates
